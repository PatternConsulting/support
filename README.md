# Pattern Support

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PatternConsulting/support.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PatternConsulting/support)

Common utility classes used by Pattern, and possibly helpful to others. This library is in its infancy, and will grow over time. For the moment, it's probably not useful outside Pattern's own projects.

## Conventions

Most of this project serves to augment the capabilities of third-party libraries, which are prefixed in the `nu.pattern` namespace. The structure reflects those libraries to indicate the intentions of those supporting classes. While this is indeed verbose, preserves clarity and avoids pollution namespaces.
